# What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You need to initialize a repository to begin saving new elements to the file.

You need to initialize because Git will not make the first commit for you.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the area where the commit is not finalized into the repository.
It's one further step than the working directory. It helps you select which files
you want to add to a commit- and you can edit this before it is finalized as a true
commit to the repository.
