How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log will give you a chronological list (from most to least recent!!) of changes
to the file

git diff will give you the differences (what has been added or subtracted) between the
most current file and earlier version

ex: git diff earlier-file current-file

# Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to try using Git to start saving my projects and showing potential employers
my work
